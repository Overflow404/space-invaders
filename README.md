# Space Invaders

Work in progress - A rust implementation of the old fashioned space invaders game

Solution of [this](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-space-invaders/) coding challenge.


## Overview

This is a modern reimagining of Space Invaders built in Rust, using:

- Bevy: a powerful, data-driven game engine built in Rust

- ECS (Entity Component System): to keep game logic modular, scalable, and clean

- Bevy’s rendering + input systems

- A custom domain layer to model gameplay logic without coupling with Bevy
